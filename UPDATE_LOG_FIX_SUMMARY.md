# Update Log Functionality - Complete Fix Report

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. **Project Filter Dropdown Issue** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Cannot select a project from the project filter dropdown due to multiple tenant assignments causing `.single()` query to fail.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `loadProjects()` function to handle multiple tenants by using array query instead of `.single()`
- Updated the function to use the first tenant when user has multiple tenant assignments
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**Files Modified**: 
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx` (lines 114-171)

### 2. **Photo Upload Functionality** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Photo upload not working due to missing storage bucket and configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Created `project-photos` storage bucket in Supabase
- Configured bucket for public access with file size limits
- Enhanced error handling for storage operations
- Added proper file name sanitization
- Improved user feedback for upload errors

**Files Modified**: 
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx` (lines 420-436)
- Created storage bucket via API
- Created `setup-storage-policies.sql` for manual policy setup

### 3. **Team Member Selection** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Team member dropdown not showing organization members due to query syntax issues and multiple tenant handling.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the team member query to use a two-step approach for better compatibility
