# FEDCORE - User Setup & Authentication Guide

## ✅ Current Setup Status

Your authentication system is **READY FOR PRODUCTION**! Here's what's already configured:

### Authentication Flow
- ✅ **Supabase Auth** integrated with email/password
- ✅ **Login page** at `/login` with proper error handling
- ✅ **Signup page** at `/signup` with automatic tenant creation
- ✅ **Session management** with automatic redirects
- ✅ **Profile creation** triggers on user signup
- ✅ **Multi-tenant support** with role-based access

### Database Tables Ready
- ✅ `auth.users` - Managed by Supabase Auth
- ✅ `public.profiles` - Extended user profiles
- ✅ `public.tenants` - Organizations/companies
- ✅ `public.user_tenants` - User-tenant relationships with roles
- ✅ All RLS policies configured

## 🚀 How to Create Users

### Method 1: Admin User (Already Set Up)
```
Email: admin@projectpro.com
Password: [The password you created]
Role: Owner (full access)
```

### Method 2: Self-Service Signup
Users can sign up themselves at `/signup`:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Fill in:
   - Full name
   - Company name (creates new tenant)
   - Email
   - Password (min 6 characters)
3. User is automatically:
   - Created in Supabase Auth
   - Added to profiles table
   - Set as owner of new tenant

### Method 3: Invite Users to Existing Tenant
Add users to your existing company/tenant:

```sql
-- First, have them sign up or create them in Supabase Dashboard
-- Then link them to your tenant:

DO $$
DECLARE
  v_user_id UUID;
  v_tenant_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Get user by email
  SELECT id INTO v_user_id FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email = 'newteammember@company.com';
  
  -- Get your tenant
  SELECT id INTO v_tenant_id FROM public.tenants 
  WHERE slug = 'your-company-slug';
  
  -- Link them as a team member
  INSERT INTO public.user_tenants (user_id, tenant_id, role, is_default)
  VALUES (v_user_id, v_tenant_id, 'member', true);
END $$;
```

### Method 4: Bulk User Import
For adding multiple users at once:

```sql
-- Bulk add team members to your tenant
WITH new_users AS (
  SELECT email, 'member'::user_role as role
  FROM (VALUES 
    ('user1@company.com'),
    ('user2@company.com'),
    ('user3@company.com')
  ) AS t(email)
)
INSERT INTO public.user_tenants (user_id, tenant_id, role)
SELECT 
  u.id,
  (SELECT id FROM public.tenants WHERE slug = 'your-company-slug'),
  nu.role
FROM new_users nu
JOIN auth.users u ON u.email = nu.email
ON CONFLICT (user_id, tenant_id) DO NOTHING;
```

## 👥 User Roles

Three role levels are configured:

### 1. Owner
- Full access to everything
- Can delete projects, manage billing
- Can invite/remove users
- Can modify company settings

### 2. Admin  
- Can create/edit/delete projects
- Can manage tasks and vendors
- Can invite users
- Cannot modify company settings

### 3. Member
- Can view and edit projects/tasks
- Can create new tasks
- Cannot delete projects
- Cannot invite users

## 📊 Capacity for 10,000+ Users

Your database is configured to handle enterprise scale:

### Current Optimizations
- ✅ All necessary indexes created
- ✅ RLS policies for data isolation
- ✅ Efficient query patterns
- ✅ Connection pooling ready

### To Enable Full Scale (Run `optimize-for-scale.sql`):
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
supabase/optimize-for-scale.sql
```

This adds:
- Additional performance indexes
- Materialized views for dashboards
- Rate limiting functions
- Maintenance procedures
- Monitoring capabilities

### Supabase Dashboard Settings for Scale
Go to **Settings > Database** and adjust:
- `max_connections`: 200
- `pool_mode`: transaction
- `default_pool_size`: 25
- `max_client_conn`: 500

## 🔐 Security Features

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 6 characters (enforced by Supabase)
- Recommended: 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols

### Email Verification (Optional)
Enable in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings:
- Require email confirmation: ON
- This sends verification emails to new users

### Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)
Can be enabled per-user in Supabase Dashboard

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after 7 days by default
- Can be configured in Supabase Dashboard
- Refresh tokens handled automatically

## 📈 Monitoring User Activity

### Check Active Users
```sql
-- Total users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;

-- Users by tenant
SELECT 
  t.name as company,
  COUNT(ut.user_id) as user_count
FROM public.tenants t
LEFT JOIN public.user_tenants ut ON t.id = ut.tenant_id
GROUP BY t.name
ORDER BY user_count DESC;

-- Recent signups
SELECT 
  email,
  created_at,
  last_sign_in_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Activity Monitoring
```sql
-- Most active users (last 7 days)
SELECT 
  p.email,
  COUNT(al.id) as actions
FROM public.activity_logs al
JOIN public.profiles p ON al.user_id = p.id
WHERE al.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY p.email
ORDER BY actions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚦 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Admin Login
```bash
# Try logging in with your admin account
Email: admin@projectpro.com
Password: [your password]
```

### 2. Test New User Signup
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Create a test account
3. Verify auto-login and redirect to dashboard

### 3. Test Multi-Tenant Isolation
1. Create two different companies
2. Verify users can only see their own data
3. Test switching between tenants (if user belongs to multiple)

### 4. Load Testing (Optional)
```javascript
// Simple load test script
for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  fetch('/api/auth/signup', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: `testuser${i}@example.com`,
      password: 'TestPass123!',
      fullName: `Test User ${i}`,
      companyName: `Test Company ${i}`
    })
  });
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### User Can't Login
1. Check email/password are correct
2. Verify user exists: `SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@email.com';`
3. Check if email is confirmed (if verification enabled)
4. Look for auth errors in Supabase Logs

### User Can't See Data
1. Verify user-tenant relationship exists
2. Check RLS policies are enabled
3. Verify tenant_id is being passed correctly

### Session Issues
1. Clear browser cookies/cache
2. Check Supabase Auth settings
3. Verify environment variables are correct

## 📱 Next Steps

### 1. Enable Email Service
In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > SMTP Settings:
- Configure SMTP for password resets
- Set up email templates

### 2. Add Social Login (Optional)
In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers:
- Enable Google, GitHub, etc.
- Add OAuth credentials

### 3. Set Up Monitoring
- Enable Supabase Analytics
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Configure uptime monitoring

### 4. Production Deployment
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- Set production environment variables
- Enable SSL/HTTPS
- Configure custom domain

## Quick Commands

### Switch to Production Mode

cp .env.local.production .env.local
npm run dev
```

### Check System Status
```sql
-- Database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));

-- Active connections
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- User count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;
```

### Emergency User Unlock
```sql
-- Reset user password (in Supabase Dashboard)
UPDATE auth.users 
SET encrypted_password = crypt('NewPassword123!', gen_salt('bf'))
WHERE email = 'user@email.com';
```
