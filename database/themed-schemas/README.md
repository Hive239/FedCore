# FedCore Themed Database Schemas

This folder contains organized, themed database schemas that extend the base `complete-production-setup-fixed.sql` with specialized functionality.

## Overview

After analyzing all SQL files in the FedCore project, I've identified **80+ additional tables** beyond your base schema, organized into **10 functional themes**. These schemas transform your project from basic project management into a comprehensive, AI-powered construction intelligence platform.

## What's Included

## Quick Start

1. **Apply base schema first:**
   ```sql
   -- Run complete-production-setup-fixed.sql in Supabase
   ```

2. **Apply themed schemas in order:**
   ```bash
   # Follow MIGRATION_ORDER.md exactly
   # Start with 04-enterprise-scaling.sql
   # End with 10-system-administration.sql
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   -- Should show 90+ tables total
   ```

## Schema Statistics

- **Base Schema**: 14 core tables
- **Additional Tables**: 80+ specialized tables  
- **Total Functionality**: 10 distinct business domains
- **RLS Policies**: All tables include proper tenant isolation
- **Indexes**: Optimized for multi-tenant performance

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Security
Every table includes Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring proper tenant isolation.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** `MIGRATION_ORDER.md` for migration instructions
2. **Choose** which themes align with your immediate needs
3. **Apply** schemas incrementally to avoid overwhelming complexity
4. **Customize** as needed - all schemas are designed to be modular

## Support

Each schema file includes:
- Detailed comments explaining table purposes
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Optimized indexes for performance  
- RLS policies for security
- Example queries where helpful

The schemas are production-ready but can be customized for your specific requirements.
